Small sekirolike game with one boss

Players can move, deflect, attack, sprint, jump, dash
Locking onto the boss with the camera is very useful

To adjust the speed of the boss attacks press "-" to decrease it and "=" to increase it (as this is a dev tool, can be pushed too high or low, breaking the boss)
